# Churn Prediction using Pycaret

Hello everyone, in this project I will give you some information about Customer Churn Prediction and we will build a Churn Prediction model together using Pycaret.

## What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn refers to the number of customers a business loses from its customer base during a specific period. This metric is particularly crucial for subscription-based businesses, such as streaming services like Netflix, music platforms like YouTube Music, and telecom providers like TÃ¼rk Telekom. Customer churn is typically expressed as a rate, calculated by dividing the number of customers lost by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period. For example, if you got 100 customers and lost 5 last month, then your monthly churn rate is 5 percent.

Customer churn is considered a significant business metric because the costs of acquiring new customers are often higher than retaining existing ones. Therefore, reducing or preventing customer churn is important for a business's long-term sustainability.

Customer churn can be influenced by various factors, including customer dissatisfaction, competition, service quality, pricing policies, customer support, and changing customer needs. To predict and prevent customer churn, businesses develop customer churn prediction models and strategies.
