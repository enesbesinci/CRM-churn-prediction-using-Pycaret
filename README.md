# Churn Prediction using Pycaret

Hello everyone, in this project I will give you some information about Customer Churn Prediction and we will build a Churn Prediction model together using Pycaret.

## Introduction

First of all, I would like to explain a concept known as **KPI** in the business world.

A **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)** is a specific metric used to measure and evaluate the performance of an organization. KPIs are often directly related to the organization's strategic goals and are used to understand, monitor and evaluate the company's performance. Using KPIs, businesses can assess progress towards achieving specific goals. Furthermore, these metrics must be quantitative so that they can be calculated and monitored.

For example, this KPI could be "Monthly Active Subscribers" for Netflix, "Monthly Total Sales Revenue" for Amazon, or "Overall Employee Happiness" for a company's human resources department.

Customer retention is also a KPI and is a metric that measures a business's ability to retain customers over a given period of time. It is calculated as a percentage and is usually expressed as the number of customers that remain with a business after a given period divided by the total number of customers at the beginning of the period.

Customer retention is important for all businesses, but it is particularly important for subscription-based businesses. This is because subscription-based businesses rely on recurring revenue from their customers. When a customer unsubscribes, the business loses this revenue.

Yes, now we have enough information about the KPI's.
## What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn refers to the number of customers a business loses from its customer base during a specific period. This metric is particularly crucial for subscription-based businesses, such as streaming services like Netflix, music platforms like YouTube Music, and telecom providers like TÃ¼rk Telekom. Customer churn is typically expressed as a rate, calculated by dividing the number of customers lost by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period. For example, if you got 100 customers and lost 5 last month, then your monthly churn rate is 5 percent.

Customer churn is considered a significant business metric because the costs of acquiring new customers are often higher than retaining existing ones. Therefore, reducing or preventing customer churn is important for a business's long-term sustainability.

Customer churn can be influenced by various factors, including customer dissatisfaction, competition, service quality, pricing policies, customer support, and changing customer needs. To predict and prevent customer churn, businesses develop customer churn prediction models and strategies.
